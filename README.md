# Computer Network Organization
This  repository contains lecture notes and labs for my computer network organization class at UTA for Fall 2020. 
## Lecture Notes
The lecture notes are a good source to revise on basic network layer concepts. It also contains some practice question with answers to test yourself. 
## Labs
### Lab 1
In lab 1, the lab required us to make a Web Server using java. 
### Lab 2
In lab 2, the lab required us to make a shortest path distance between 2 nodes which I made using java.
### Lab 3
The lab 3 was fairly straight forward. It tested our knowledge to understand basic network details that we got from the terminal. This also required us to use Wireshark to get the response and reply for a http protocol.
