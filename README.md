# Computer Network Organization
This couse goes over design and analysis of computer networks. Emphasis on the OSI architecture but discusses other schemes (e.g., ARPAnet). Data link control, local networks, protocols/architectures, network access protocols, transport protocols, internetworking, and ISDN.

## Lecture Notes
The lecture notes are a good source to revise on basic network layer concepts. It also contains some practice question with answers to test yourself. 
## Labs
### Lab 1
In lab 1, the lab required us to make a Web Server using java. 
### Lab 2
In lab 2, the lab required us to make a shortest path distance between 2 nodes which I made using java.
### Lab 3
The lab 3 was fairly straight forward. It tested our knowledge to understand basic network details that we got from the terminal. This also required us to use Wireshark to get the response and reply for a http protocol.
